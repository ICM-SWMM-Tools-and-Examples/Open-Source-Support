# Innovyze open source scripts
This repo will host open source code that can be used in the various Innovyze products. This includes Ruby for the UI/Exchange, SQL and other useful scripts.

## Disclaimer
Scripts posted here are generally developed by Innovyze Support on the back of a specific customer request. We're not computer scientists. Therefore, the scripts might not always be optimised, prettyfied, refactored, etc. Feel very welcome to contribute with pull requests and raise issues for code that you'd like to see here.

Scripts hosted here are meant to be boilerplate and anonymised snippets of a common function. The aim is creating a library that empowers customers to help themselves, discuss improvements and contribute with their own ideas. Hopefully you can come here, quickly pick and choose from the existing library, and Frankenstein your code for your own needs.

This is not the place to develop bespoke code for customers, nor ever will we post it here. This can be requested from Innovyze within the scope of an implementation project.
