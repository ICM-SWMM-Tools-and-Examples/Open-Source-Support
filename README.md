# Innovyze open source scripts
This repo will host open source code that can be used in the various Innovyze products. This includes Ruby for the UI/Exchange, SQL and other useful scripts.

## Disclaimer:
Scripts posted here are generally developed by Innovyze Support on the back of a specific case. We're not computer scientists, and therefore, the scripts might not always be optimised, prettyfied, refactored, etc. Feel very welcome to contribute with pull requests and raise issues for code that you'd like to see here.

Code hosted here is meant to be both boilerplate and anonymised. It aims at creating a library on the back of common code requests, so that you pick and choose and build your own code for your own needs. We will not develop bespoke code for customers, nor post it here. However, this can be requested from Innovyze as a paid project.
