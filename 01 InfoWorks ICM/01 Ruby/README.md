# InfoWorks ICM Ruby scripts
Each folder contains an example of a task that can be performed using a Ruby Script. These can be either UI scripts or Exchange scripts.

## UI scripts
Scripts following the nomenclature `UI_script.rb` are  run from within the ICM UI. A quick way to get started is:
1. Create a `test.rb` file in a known location (preferably close to the drive root and without special characters in the path)
2. Create an Action which points at the Ruby script
3. Copy paste the code you are testing into this file using a text editor
4. Run it in ICM in a relevant network
