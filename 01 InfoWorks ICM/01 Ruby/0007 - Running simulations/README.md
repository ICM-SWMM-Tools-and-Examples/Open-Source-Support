# Run a simulation from scratch
This [script](EX_script.rb) creates a new run object from database objects and runs a simulation. Example [database](database.zip) and trigger [bat file](exchange.bat) attached.

See [documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md) for more detailed information (props to the Innovyze development team 🙏).
